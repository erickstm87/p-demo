Structure of the Talk

1. Create a react app `npx create-react-app [application name]`
2. Go to hmtl5up and look for a theme. 
    1. Which theme is right for you?
    2. too complex?
    3. too simple?
        1. Potential pitfalls when incorporating your new site?
3. Pick a theme - for talk we'll use miniport
4. Start moving over the assets and images from the html5up template into the public directory of the react application
5. Clear out app.js and index.html 
6. Move the contents from index.html in the html5up template over to react application app.js file 
    1. Two gotchas, replace all instances of class with className, comments in html will cause errors! take them out.
7. Once you see that you can render a site with all content in app.js, start divvying off into components 
8. User will hopefully recognize that these divs can be rendered using json, start doing that
9. Deploy to world wide web
    1. I'll talk a little about buying a domain from google and how I've included notes that will show user how to link domain to heroku application 
10. Start thinking about state and props, things on the site that would require user interaction (won't have time to demo) 
11. If we have time I'll show how a new component is developed with git branch
